- calculated the Networth so it updates with the amount of stocks bought or money deposited/withdrawn 
- updated the print statments to be more colourful and readable
- added a method to withdraw funds. There is an issue with the program automatically exiting when I do this - I'm not sure how to 
  fix this. Theoretically, this should be updating the Networth as well as the proper balance is shown at the end. It also says "Add 
  funds" instead of "Withdraw" even though I do have a method in Ink to change it.
