third Java Assignment

**Note:** The folder is called NEWStockup as I had to completely copy the original code into new packages/files as this was the only way I could figure out how to deal with the version issue I was having on Thursday. The main java file is still called StockUp as it originally was.

- calculated the Networth so it updates with the amount of stocks bought or money deposited/withdrawn 
- updated the print statments to be more colourful and readable
- added a method to withdraw funds. There is an issue with the program automatically exiting when I do this - I'm not sure how to 
  fix this. Theoretically, this should be updating the Networth as well as the proper balance is shown at the end. It also says "Add funds" instead of "Withdraw" even though I do have a method in Ink to change it.
